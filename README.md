# Rino - Remote Irssi Notifier - OSX version
Irssi SSH notifier for MacOSX. It uses terminal-notifier to talk with the notification center, SSH to publish its port on the remote host and an Irssi plugin to push notification to the listener.

## TODO
* Fix message split
* Include and fix irssi script (perl)
* Damonize (start, stop, status)
* Manage pidfile and signal handling
